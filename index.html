			<h1 style="color:#4BBAFA">Hi! My name is Benjamin Li. And this is my website. On here is a showcase of the projects I have worked that I am passionate about and would like to present to the world. </h1>
			<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>I am a freshman college student studying Computer Engineering at Boston University. On this page you can find all of programming projects from high school until now, along with some papers that I have written that I am proud of. My academic pursuits are focused in computer science, physics, and math. These three things are what I think I'm best at. Outside of school, I have interests in analyzing the biopharmaceutical industry, learning guitar, computer hardware, and participating in hackathons. 

			This is my third website, the first one being a submission to a html competition, and the second being the second iteration of that page. It's down right now, but I plan on putting it back up to show how much I have improved. I'm not great at html, or css, or javascript, but I hope this website impresses anyways.</p> 
			<h2>How It All Got Started</h2>
			<p>I didn't find out about what I wanted to do until the summer of 2013, when I took an html class. I learned all the basics, but what I really took from that class was an interest in building something from the ground up, whether it be a website like this, or a program. From there, I learned Java in APCS and started to branch out the width of my programming knowledge. After Java was Python, which was an easy port, then a dabble in JavaScript for a summer internship, and finally MATLAB. In the future, I'd like to get really good at a single languange, most likely Java, and build something truly game-changing with it.</p>
			<h2>Why I Like What I Like</h2>
			<p>As I said earlier, my academic passions are in computer science, physics, and math. Throughout highschool and college, I've found that my brain works the best when it is following a formula. That's why I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering, which combines all three! I am also planning on double majoring in Electrical, and perhaps getting a minor in either pure CS or Math.</p>
			<h2>Plans Moving Forward</h2>
			<p>I think I've decided on getting my master's after college. Hopefully MIT will accept me, but we'll see about that. Regardless, I'm gunning for Ph.D, and then getting a job in the industry, probably at some big tech company, but biopharma is okay with me.</p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<p>The majority of this website was made completely from scratch, with the exception of some css material, which I created using tutorials from w3schools.com. I highly recommend them for those learning the basics to CSS/JS, as their tutorials are incredibly practical.</p>
